# MOOC User Action Analysis

This project involves analyzing the **MOOC User Action** dataset, aiming to gain insights into user behavior and engagement with the course material. The dataset contains records of actions taken by users within a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environment, and the project focuses on applying data analysis techniques using Python and Tableau for visualizing patterns.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze user actions, course completion rates, and interaction patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use statistical and graphical techniques to explore relationships between various features (e.g., user engagement, course type).
- **Visualization**: Create compelling visualizations using **Tableau** to convey insights about user behavior.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify trends such as drop-off points, successful user behaviors, and engagement strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Preprocessing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Machine Learning**: (Optional) Scikit-learn for classification/regression tasks (if needed)
- **Database**: MySQL (if applicable for storing preprocessed data)

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/prajwaldevaraj-2001/MOOC-USER-ACTION.git

## Install dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages.
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Set up MySQL (if needed):
If your project involves using a database to store preprocessed data, ensure that MySQL is installed on your local machine or use a cloud service like MySQL Workbench.
- Create a database and table(s) to store the MOOC dataset.
- Update the database connection details in your Python scripts to point to the database.

## Run the Analysis (Python):
After setting up the environment, you can run the analysis scripts.
python analyze_data.py

## Run the Tableau Visualizations:
Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
Connect to the data source (e.g., CSV file or MySQL database) and load the analysis results.
Create visualizations based on the datasets.

## How It Works
Data Exploration
- Explore different features of the dataset, such as user interactions, course IDs, completion times, and user demographics.
- Identify key columns like user_id, action_type, timestamp, and course_id for in-depth analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing data, remove outliers, and transform variables as needed.
- Convert timestamps into meaningful time features (e.g., time of day, day of the week).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of user actions and engagement using charts such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- Perform correlation analysis to identify patterns between user actions and course outcomes.

## Visualization with Tableau
- Build interactive dashboards in Tableau to showcase trends in user engagement.
- Create filters to examine behavior across different time periods, user types, and course types.

## Project Insights
Key Findings (Example)
- High Drop-off Rate: Users who complete the first 20% of the course tend to have a higher completion rate.
- User Engagement: Higher interaction with course materials correlates with better final grades and course completion.
- Time Spent vs. Completion: Users who spend more time on certain types of content (e.g., quizzes) tend to perform better in the course.

## Visualizations
- Engagement Trends: Line charts showing the number of actions per user over time.
- Completion Rates: Pie charts and bar graphs showing the percentage of users who completed the course versus those who didn’t.
- User Interaction: Heatmaps visualizing the times of day with the highest user activity.

## Future Improvements
- Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning models to predict the likelihood of course completion based on user engagement patterns.
- Action Classification: Classify actions (e.g., watching a video, taking a quiz) into categories to understand how different types of interactions impact engagement and completion.
- User Segmentation: Use clustering techniques to segment users based on their behavior patterns, allowing personalized recommendations for engagement.
